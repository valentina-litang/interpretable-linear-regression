# interpretable-linear-regression
The `verbal_scores` dataset contains features potentially predictive of verbal reasoning scores (`ppvtr.36`). I was interested in identifying risk factors for low verbal reasoning scores to determine if a child should be enrolled in an after-school program that has been shown to improve outcomes.

I built a linear regression that preserves predictive power while simplifying statistical models.
